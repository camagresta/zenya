        <p className="smallerP cbdP larger">
          CBD stands for cannabidiol. It is the second most prevalent of the
          active ingredients of cannabis (marijuana). While CBD is an essential
          component of medical marijuana, it is derived directly from the hemp
          plant, which is a cousin of the marijuana plant. Because it’s
          non-psychoactive, CBD is widely regarded to possess incredible health
          potential.

        <h2 className="cbdHeader">Will Zenya products get me high?</h2>
        <p className="smallerP cbdP">
          No. They will not get you high. CBD is non-psychoactive with a
          seperate effect from THC that is relaxing.
        </p>
        <h2 className="cbdHeader">Do your products have THC in them?</h2>
        <p className="smallerP cbdP">
          No where near enough to affect you. Zenya contains only teeny tiny
          traces of THC, the stuff in marijuana that gives you a buzz.
        </p>
        <h2 className="cbdHeader">Will I fail a drug test if I use CBD oil?</h2>
        <p className="smallerP cbdP">
          It's unlikely that CBD will show up in a drug test. If you have to
          take one for employment, chances are they will be screening for
          cannabis. But that actually means they're looking for the presence of
          THC or THC metabolites—not CBD.
